## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript Vanilla
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I have learned to use The (Constraint Validation API) to create a server-side based validation with JavaScript. Learned how to create properly a form.

### Continued development

I am trying to reinforce the usage of (Constraint Validation API) and I am still learning JavaScript, trying to figure out alot of things. This is my first project with JavaScript implemented and happy to announce my first JavaScript project.

### Useful resources

- [Constraint Validation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation#the_constraint_validation_api) - This helped me to use Constraint Validation API for creating a Client-side form validation.
- [Server-side form validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the usage and the importance of creating a Server-side validation instead of Client-side.
